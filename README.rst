Coupling SeaFEM - OpenFAST3.5 
========

Dynamic link library of OpenFAST3.5 for the coupling with SeaFEM seakeeping solver.
Exchange is possible with ElastoDyn and SubDyn modules.
Enables simulations for single turbine platforms.
A test case is provided for the OC3-Hywind system.

OpenFAST and FAST.Farm are maintained and developed by researchers and software
engineers at the `National Renewable Energy Laboratory <http://www.nrel.gov/>`_
